                  <h6 class="h5 fw-bold border-bottom-1 border-dark">Appreciation</h6>              
                  One of the most significant benefits of investing in property is the potential for appreciation or an increase in the value of the property over time. Historically, real estate has appreciated at a rate higher than inflation, which means that property investments can provide a hedge against rising costs of living.

                <h6 class="h5 fw-bold border-bottom-1 border-dark">Cash flow</h6>
                Another benefit of investing in property is the potential for cash flow or the income that the property generates through rental income. This can provide a steady stream of income that can help offset the rising costs of living               </span> 
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item list-group-item d-flex gap-1 align-items-center"><i class="fa fa-check text-success fw-bold fs-2 pe-3" ></i>

                <h6 class="h5 fw-bold border-bottom-1 border-dark" >Tax benefits</h6>
                Investing in property also provides a number of tax benefits. For example, landlords are able to deduct many expenses related to the property, such as mortgage interest and property management fees, from their taxable income.               </span>

                <h6 class="h5 fw-bold border-bottom-1 border-dark">Forced savings: </h6>
                Investing in property can also act as a forced savings plan. Each mortgage payment goes toward both paying off the loan and building equity in the property. This can help to increase the investor's net worth over time and provide a nest egg for retirement or other long-term financial goals.

                <h6 class="h5 fw-bold border-bottom-1 border-dark" >Diversification</h6>
                Investing in property is a great way to diversify your investment portfolio. Since real estate is not correlated with stocks and bonds, it can provide a level of protection for your investments during market downturns.
